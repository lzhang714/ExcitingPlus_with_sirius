! Phonon spectrum of Aluminium.  First run with task=0, and then with task=200.

! You can submit the same job (with task=200) on as many machines as you like,
! but they must be be able to see the same directory. Each machine with compute
! a row of a particular dynamical matrix. When run with task=220, the code
! assembles all the pieces to construct the dynamical matrices throughout the
! Brillouin zone. The phonon DOS can also be produced with task=210.
