! Calculating the Mossbauer effect hyperfine parameters for bcc Fe, namely the
! contact charge density, the contact magnetic hyperfine field and the electric
! field gradient (EFG). In this case the EFG is zero because of symmetry.

! The hyperfine magnetic field is difficult to calculate accurately. This is
! partly due to the neglect of the orbital and dipolar contributions, but mainly
! because most of the contact magnetisation arises from the polarised core s
! states. One therefore has to switch on core polarisation with
! 'spincore=.true.', but in addition any semi-core s states should also be moved
! to the core and thus treated with the full Dirac equation. Consequently, this
! example requires a special species file (Fe.in), in which the 3s states are in
! the core. Also note that the field is quite sensitive to the number of empty
! states and k-points. Experimentally the hyperfine field is 33.9 Tesla
! [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 33, 159 (1972)]. A complete derivation of the formulae can
! be found in Phys. Rev. B  53, 3271 (1987).
