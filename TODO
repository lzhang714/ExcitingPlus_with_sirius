* clean SHT part
* test screened/unscreened U
* scalapack diagonalization
* regression tests
* cleanup gndstate
* [?] more compact representation for wave-functions
* parallelize matrix elements over G, not over interband transitions
* symmetry: lattice+magnetic
* timers in new sic code

* the main Elk code is diverging; at least, merge the k-point generation
* [???] Light version of the code without EXX, OEP, Hartree-Fock...
* [?] split source to levels (like in blas): basic subroutines, generic lapw subroutiens, main elk subroutines

* SIC code: optimize dot product
